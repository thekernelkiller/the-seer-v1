# The Seer v1 - Financial Research Agent
## Complete Project Foundation & Architecture

---

## 🎯 Vision & Problem Statement

### **Core Problem**
Financial investment research requires analyzing multiple complex, interconnected data dimensions:
- **Fundamental Data**: Company financials, ratios, growth metrics
- **Technical Analysis**: Price patterns, volume, momentum indicators  
- **Market Context**: Sector trends, macro environment, regulatory landscape
- **News & Sentiment**: Breaking news, social sentiment, analyst opinions

Currently, this requires:
- Multiple expensive data subscriptions ($Bloomberg, $Reuters, $FactSet)
- Deep financial expertise (CFA-level knowledge)
- Hours/days of manual research across disparate sources
- Synthesis of conflicting signals into coherent investment thesis

### **Our Solution**
**AI Research Analyst** that democratizes institutional-quality investment research:
```
User Query: "Give me a report on investment opportunities in RELIANCE.NS"
           ↓
Agent: *Orchestrates multi-dimensional analysis*
           ↓
Output: Comprehensive investment report with executive summary,
        fundamental analysis, technical setup, sector context,
        news sentiment, risk assessment, and price targets
```

### **Product Philosophy**
- **User-Centric**: Focus on value, quality, and actionability - users don't care about LLM complexity
- **Quality First**: Prefer accuracy and insight over speed or cost optimization
- **Transparency**: Show reasoning chains and source attribution
- **Risk-Aware**: Acknowledge uncertainty and provide confidence scores

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

### **Core Principles**

#### **1. Hybrid Approach: Quality MVP → Production Scale**
- Build once, scale smartly (not MVP → rebuild)
- Start with working high-quality foundation with production vision
- Iterative enhancement rather than architectural rewrites

#### **2. Framework Strategy**
**LangGraph + FastAPI Hybrid Architecture**
- **LangGraph**: Agent orchestration, memory, workflow management
- **FastAPI**: API layer leveraging proven scalable patterns (Redis, Pydantic)
- **Best of Both**: Agentic capabilities + scalable backend patterns

**Why not pure framework approach?**
- **LangGraph alone**: Missing proven scalability patterns for API layer
- **Pure FastAPI**: Reinventing agent orchestration complexity
- **Hybrid**: Leverages strengths of both, production-ready foundation

#### **3. State Management Strategy**
```python
class AnalysisSession:
    langgraph_state: LangGraphState    # Agent workflow state & memory
    fastapi_cache: RedisCache          # API response caching
    user_context: UserSession          # Authentication & usage tracking
```

### **Framework Evaluation Results**

#### **LangGraph vs Custom Redis State Management**
- ✅ **LangGraph Wins**: Built-in persistence, memory, human-in-the-loop, streaming, time travel
- ❌ **Custom Redis**: Would require building all orchestration from scratch
- **Decision**: Use LangGraph for agent layer, Redis for API-level caching

#### **DSPy Consideration**
- **Powerful for**: Automatic prompt optimization, quality improvement over time
- **Decision**: Future consideration post-MVP. Focus on proven orchestration first
- **Rationale**: LangGraph provides faster time-to-market, DSPy adds complexity without MVP validation

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Decisions

### **Core Technology Stack**
```yaml
Backend Framework: FastAPI + Uvicorn
Agent Framework: LangGraph  
LLM Provider: Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro)
Database: PostgreSQL (existing pattern)
Cache Layer: Redis (existing pattern)
Vector Store: Qdrant (existing pattern)
Validation: Pydantic v2 (existing pattern)
```

### **LLM Strategy: Google Gemini**

#### **Capabilities Utilization**
1. **Function Calling**: Financial data tools, web search tools
2. **Structured Output**: Consistent analysis report format via JSON schemas
3. **Thinking Mode**: Complex reasoning for synthesis and conflict resolution
4. **Multi-turn**: Maintain context for follow-up questions

#### **Thinking Mode Integration**
```python
# Strategic usage points for enhanced reasoning
synthesis_agent: "Think through conflicting signals from multiple sources"
risk_assessment: "Reason through multiple risk factors and probabilities"
sector_analysis: "Connect macro trends to company-specific performance"
news_impact: "Evaluate how recent news affects long-term valuation"
```

#### **Cost Philosophy**
- **Quality over Cost**: Don't optimize Gemini costs at expense of output quality
- **Rationale**: Token costs manageable, user value comes from analysis quality
- **Focus**: Optimize expensive data API costs (Twelve Data) instead

### **Data Strategy & API Management**

#### **Twelve Data API Management**
```python
# Intelligent caching based on data volatility
class SmartFinancialCache:
    fundamentals: 7_days          # Quarterly earnings rarely change
    daily_prices: 1_day           # EOD prices stable after market close  
    intraday: 15_minutes          # Live trading data
    news_sentiment: 2_hours       # News sentiment analysis window
```

**Cost Optimization Strategy:**
- Batch requests for multiple tickers when possible
- Pre-warm cache for Nifty 50 stocks during market hours
- Smart invalidation (only refresh when markets open)
- Rate limiting and quota monitoring

#### **News & Sentiment Sources**
```yaml
Primary: Serper API (web search)
Sources Priority:
  1. Economic Times, Mint, Business Standard
  2. MoneyControl, LiveMint  
  3. Company press releases, exchange filings
  4. Social sentiment (Twitter, Reddit) - lower weight
```

### **Indian Market Specifics**
```yaml
Market Context:
  - Trading Hours: 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST
  - Ticker Format: NSE (.NS suffix)
  - Currency: INR (with USD context)
  - Regulatory: SEBI compliance, Indian accounting standards
  
Key Considerations:
  - FII/DII flow dynamics (institutional money flow)
  - Monsoon impact on agriculture/consumer stocks
  - INR strength/weakness effect on exporters vs importers
  - Sectoral rotation patterns (IT → Banking → Pharma cycles)
  - Festival season effects on consumer spending
```

## 🤖 Agentic System Design

### **Architecture Pattern: Orchestrator-Workers + Synthesis**

Based on [Anthropic's agent patterns](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents), our optimal pattern:

```
User Query → Master Orchestrator Agent
                    ↓
            [Dynamic Planning & Routing]
                    ↓
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                         │
    ▼                                         ▼
Market Context Worker              Fundamental Analysis Worker
(Macro, Sector, FII/DII)          (Twelve Data APIs)
    │                                         │
    ▼                                         ▼
News/Sentiment Worker              Technical Analysis Worker  
(Serper + Web Search)             (Price data, indicators)
                    │
                    ▼
            Synthesis Agent
         (Conflict Resolution + Report Generation)
```

### **Analysis Sequence (Optimized Flow)**
```
1. Market Context → 2. News/Events → 3. Fundamentals → 4. Technical → 5. Synthesis
```

**Rationale for Sequence:**
- **Market Context First**: Understand macro environment before micro analysis
- **News Early**: Breaking news can invalidate historical fundamental/technical analysis  
- **Fundamentals Before Technical**: Ground analysis in business reality
- **Synthesis Last**: Integrate all perspectives with conflict resolution

### **Conflict Resolution Framework**

Instead of treating conflicts as problems, leverage them as insights:

```python
class ConflictAnalysis(BaseModel):
    bull_case: AnalysisPoint
    bear_case: AnalysisPoint  
    confidence_weighted_synthesis: str
    risk_factors: List[str]
    source_attribution: Dict[str, str]
    resolution_reasoning: str
```

**Conflict Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Confidence Scoring**: Weight findings by confidence + source quality
2. **Source Hierarchy**: SEC filings > Company guidance > News > Social sentiment
3. **Time Sensitivity**: Recent data overrides older conflicting information
4. **Sector Context**: Conflicts may reveal important market nuances

### **Context Management Strategy**

```python
class ResearchContext(BaseModel):
    session_id: str
    original_query: str
    analysis_plan: List[AnalysisTask]
    findings: Dict[str, AgentFindings]  # worker_id -> findings
    conflicts: List[ConflictItem]
    confidence_scores: Dict[str, float]
    reasoning_chain: List[ReasoningStep]
    data_freshness: Dict[str, datetime]
```

**Benefits of Approach:**
- **Traceability**: Every conclusion traceable to source data
- **Transparency**: Clear reasoning chains for user understanding
- **Quality Control**: Multiple validation layers
- **Scalability**: Modular design allows independent worker scaling

    }
}
```

### **Tool Architecture**

**Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) Design:**
Following Anthropic's guidance on tool design quality:

```python
@tool
async def get_financial_statements(
    ticker: str,
    statement_type: Literal["income", "balance", "cash_flow"],
    period: Literal["annual", "quarterly"] = "quarterly",
    limit: int = 4
) -> FinancialStatementData:
    """
    Retrieve financial statement data for Indian stock analysis.
    
    Args:
        ticker: NSE ticker (e.g., "RELIANCE.NS", "TCS.NS")
        statement_type: Type of financial statement
        period: Annual or quarterly data
        limit: Number of periods to retrieve (max 8)
    
    Returns:
        Structured financial data with metadata
        
    Example:
        get_financial_statements("TCS.NS", "income", "quarterly", 4)
        # Returns last 4 quarters of TCS income statements
    """
    # Implementation with caching, error handling, rate limiting
```

## 📊 Quality Assurance Framework

### **Multi-Layer Validation**
1. **Worker Level**: Each agent validates its own outputs against data quality
2. **Cross-Validation**: Workers can query each other's findings for consistency
3. **Synthesis Level**: Final agent ensures coherent narrative and conflict resolution

### **Quality Metrics**
```python
class QualityMetrics(BaseModel):
    data_freshness_score: float      # How recent is the data?
    source_reliability_score: float   # Quality of data sources  
    analysis_completeness: float     # All dimensions covered?
    confidence_calibration: float    # Are confidence scores well-calibrated?
    reasoning_transparency: float    # Is logic chain clear?
    actionability_score: float      # Can user act on recommendations?
```

### **Error Handling Philosophy**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue analysis with available data + disclaimers
- **User-Friendly Messaging**: "Unable to fetch latest earnings, using last known data from X"
- **Monitoring**: Track API success rates, data freshness, analysis quality over time
